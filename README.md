# Smart Attendance through Facial Recognition 

Attendance through facial recognition is the future. This application is a low-cost, adaptive and extensible attendance system focused on eradicating the traditional attendance procedure (calling out names) prone to proxies and manual errors.

## How does it work? ##

We have used a pre trained model Keras-OpenFace which is an open source Keras implementation of the OpenFace (Originally Torch implemented)
