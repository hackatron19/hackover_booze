# Smart Attendance through Facial Recognition 

Attendance through facial recognition is the future. This application is a low-cost, adaptive and extensible attendance system focused on eradicating the traditional attendance procedure (calling out names) prone to proxies and manual errors.

# How does it work? 

For taking attendance we'll be using cameras installed in the classroom/office and perform facial recognition
