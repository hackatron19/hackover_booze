# Problem Statement

Manual attendance is tedious and time consuming, inherent to proxies and manual errors, late updation of the studentâ€™s attendance on ERP site.


# Smart Attendance through Facial Recognition 

Attendance through facial recognition is the future. This application is a low-cost, adaptive and extensible attendance system focused on eradicating the traditional attendance procedure (calling out names) prone to proxies and manual errors.

------------------------------------------


# How does it work? 

For taking attendance we'll be using the cameras installed in the classroom/office and perform facial recognition on the faces of students/employees. During their registration specific number of photos will be taken of pupil to be added to the dataset, which later on be used to train our deep learning face recognition model which will be done every year to retrain the model to prevent faulty system due to evolving faces.

Students can view their daily attendance on their ERP which will contain two divisions, a login page for the students with view-access only and an Admin section with read and write access. We will also provide a report option to students and quick response to sort out any issues regarding any faults in attendance marking.

# Technologies Used

## Facial Recognition
We have used a pre trained model Keras-OpenFace which is an open source Keras implementation of the OpenFace (Originally Torch implemented)
